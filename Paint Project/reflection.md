# Milestone 6

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone, since it is the last milestone for the paint project, we simply just put all the pieces together, in a sense. We have all the classes and member functions that we need to make the paint project possible, so all that's left to do is to create the tool and color tools, and then add functionality to them. We also created an eraser class so that we didn't have to rerun the program everytime if we wanted to clear it. 

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
The hardest challenge for this milestone was definitely the unique pointers. I still am quite unfamiliar with unique pointers and so it took a lot of time for me to implement it into the code correctly. I had to go through previous assignments and labs to learn more about unique pointers. We had to work with unique pointers to a Button class stored inside a vector, and that unique pointers are just different compared to everything else in that it has member functions of its own such as std::move and std::make_unique.
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I learned in this milestone was more of an abstract concept in computer science. I learned how all the classes that I have created in the previous milestones contribute and build up into a workable and functional program, which I think is a lot of what real world programmming is like. I had to go through a lot of the previous classes from 2 or 3 milestones ago to remember their member functions, and what they did. In the real world, it would be more akin to looking at someone else's code and documentation and using it to expand further upon the program.
